# Silk Phial

## Features

• Functions exactly like a standard vanilla tool.

• Grants 3 spools of Silk on each use under normal circumstances.

• When the Architect Crest is equipped, the Silk gained alternates between 1 and 2 per use. This adjustment ensures that the tool on this crest isn’t overwhelmingly strong compared to other crests.


## Known Issues

• Currently no use animation has been implemented. (because I was not able to do it)

• Localization is limited to English only, as the mod forces its custom display name and description regardless of the in-game language settings.

## Notes

This is my first mod that I made in both Silksong and Unity/BepInEx so expect bugs (though not many). If you want to help me to add animations or to improve the code (which is very unprofessional and some of it is made by AI) you could contribute.
